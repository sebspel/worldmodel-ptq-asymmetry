# Vendored platform training entrypoints — provenance

These files are copied from the platform so the foundation trainings run "as used"
(SPEC §Scope, PLAN Phase 2). They are otherwise unmodified — the DINOv3-WM track's only
behavioural change is layered on top via Hydra (`conf/experiment/dinov3.yaml` →
`model._target_: src.dino_patch.DINOv3PreJEPA`), never by editing the wheel or these copies.

**Deliberate divergences from the tag** (kept minimal, recorded here):

- `prejepa.py`: removed `spt.callbacks.CPUOffloadCallback()` from the `pl.Trainer`
  callbacks list. The entrypoint is frozen at swm tag `0.1.1`, but we pin
  `stable-pretraining==0.1.7`, which no longer ships that callback (cross-package
  version skew — see CLAUDE.md §10). 0.1.7 has no equivalent offload callback, and it is
  a GPU-memory optimisation only (no effect on the model, latents, loss, or eval), so the
  line is dropped rather than replaced. DINOv3-WM (frozen ViT-S/16, batch 32) fits the
  L40S without it. `lewm.py` does not reference this callback, so it needs no change.

- `lewm.py`: `SaveCkptCallback` was passed `cfg=cfg` (the whole training config) →
  `save_pretrained` wrote that as `config.json`, which has no top-level `_target_`, so
  `load_pretrained`'s `instantiate(config)` returns a dict and `.load_state_dict` fails at
  eval time. Changed to `cfg=cfg.model` to match `prejepa.py` (which already passes
  `cfg.model`), so `config.json` is the model node and reconstructs the model. Preventive —
  does not fix checkpoints already saved with the whole cfg (repair those config.json files
  to their `["model"]` sub-node; the state_dict is unaffected).

**Licence.** These files are MIT-licensed by their upstream authors and keep that licence here;
this repository's own `LICENSE` does not cover them. The text is at
`licenses/stable-worldmodel-LICENSE.txt`, copied verbatim. Note the revision gap: the tag vendored
below ships **no** `LICENSE` file — upstream added one later, in `ecc74e3` (2026-08-18, "Add MIT
License to the project"), which is where the copied text comes from. At the vendored tag the MIT
grant is declared in `pyproject.toml` (`license="MIT"`, plus the OSI MIT classifier) rather than as
a licence file.

- **Source:** `galilai-group/stable-worldmodel`
- **Tag:** `0.1.1` (matches the `stable-worldmodel==0.1.1` pin in `uv.lock`)
- **Commit:** `15a5538d492ae524c64cb18cc56a2d70611e877e`
- **Note:** entrypoints + their Hydra configs are not shipped in the PyPI wheel, so they
  are fetched from the tagged GitHub tree.

Only the config groups the two entrypoints actually pull are vendored (the other
`scripts/train/*` entrypoints and their configs are intentionally omitted — SPEC §Simplicity).
